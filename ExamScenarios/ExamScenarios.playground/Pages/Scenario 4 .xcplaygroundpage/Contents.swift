//: ## Your goal
//: Reproduce this image:
//:
//: ![Velocity Girl](VelocityGirl.png "Velocity Girl")
/*:
 ## Notes:
 * you will work on a canvas that is 400 pixels wide by 600 pixels high
 * strongly recommend that you make a plan [using this storyboard template](http://russellgordon.ca/rsgc/2016-17/ics2o/Storyboard%20Planning%20Template.pdf) (I have hard copies available if you are in class)
 * you can use the Digital Color Meter program to obtain an RGB color value (Command-Shift-C), then [go to this site](http://rgb.to/), paste the result, and use the HSB values provided.
 * efficiency counts: employ loops and/or function(s) and/or conditional statements to write compact code
